# Business Sales Dashboard & Reporting System

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes sales data (customers, products, and orders) to compute KPIs and visualize trends for business insights.  
It demonstrates end-to-end skills in **Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib)** and **SQL**, aligned with real-world business technology solutions.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- Python: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib  
- MySQL (data storage & schema)  
- Google Colab (analysis & visualization)  
- GitHub (version control & portfolio)

## 📂 Dataset
Three CSV files:
- `customers.csv`
- `orders.csv`

- Seasonal peaks in Q2 and Q4 indicate high-demand periods  

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone the repo and open the notebook in Google Colab.  
2. Upload the three CSV files (`customers.csv`, `orders.csv`, `products.csv`).  
3. Run all cells to reproduce the analysis.
